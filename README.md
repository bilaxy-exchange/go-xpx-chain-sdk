# ProximaX Sirius Blockchain Golang SDK

Official ProximaX Sirius Blockchain SDK Library in Golang.

The ProximaX Sirius Catapult Chain Golang SDK works as a lightweight Golang library for interacting with the Sirius Blockchain. It provides a complete library set coverage, and supports synchronous and asynchronous requests.

## Getting Started

All catapult stuff starts from importing sdk:

```go
import "github.com/bilaxy-exchange/go-xpx-chain-sdk/sdk"
```

Then create a Catapult network configuration

For *Testnet*:
```go
conf, err := sdk.NewConfig("http://localhost:3000",sdk.Testnet)
```
Or for *Mainnet*:
```go
conf, err := sdk.NewConfig("http://localhost:3000",sdk.Mainnet)
```

Construct a new REST Catapult client
```go
client := sdk.NewClient(nil, conf)
```

Use this client to get current blockchain height

```go
chainHeight, err := client.Blockchain.GetChainHeight(context.Background())
```

A [Context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/) type is the first argument in any service method for specifying
deadlines, cancelation signals, and other request-scoped values
